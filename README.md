Baker, C.,J, C. H. Fr√®re, H. A. Campbell, T. R. Irwin, C. E., Franklin. Membership of crocodile social environments is dictated by male philopatry.

We provide the supporting R code that was used in the data analysis and prepartion of the manuscript "Membership of crocodile social environment is dictated by male philopatry" which has been submitted for review on the 2021-01-05. All raw data is available from the Dryad Digital Respository: TO BE ADDED UPON ACCEPTANCE OF THE MANUSCRIPT 

The R code to classify the movement tactics of male crocodiles has not been included within this respository, as it was originally developed by Kaitlin Barham as part of her 
Honours degree. All code relating to this methodology is currently under embargo until her currently in preparation manuscript has been accepted for publication. An advanced 
version of her manuscript methods detailing how the movement metrics were calculated and why they were selected, along with her approch to classifying the movement tactics of 
individuals has been supplied as Supplementary material 1 of the current manuscript. 

To faciliate the repeatability of the analyses conducted within this manuscript, we have supplied a data file (Baker_et_al_crocodile_movement_tactics.csv) which contains the 
assigned movement tactic of each male crocodile utilised within this analysis. If further clarrification of the code used to classify crocodile movement patterns is required 
please contact the authors. 

To facilitate the replication of the results and analyses undertaken in the manuscript, all of the R code used for the analysis has been supplied in the primary folder of
this respository. Unless stated otherwise, all of the R code contained within this respository was created by Cameron J. Baker. 

All of the code has been formatted to run within the provided R project and folder layout. To complete all of the analyses contained within the manuscript, it is recommended that
the R scripts be run in the numerical order that they are presented, as later scripts require the outputs from the earlier R scripts to be run. Contained within each R script is
a list of all of the analyses included.

Also included is a folder named R_functions. This folder contains all of the custom R functions that were created in order to perform the analyses. Where required in the primary
scripts these functions will be remotely called in. Full details of what each function requires as inputs and what they do is contained within the R script of each function. 

All of the analyses have been created and run within R version 3.6.1
